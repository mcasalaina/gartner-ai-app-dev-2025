# 🔬 Deep Research Agent UI Specification

## 📋 Overview

This specification outlines the requirements for creating a graphical user interface for the Deep Research Agent. The UI will provide an intuitive way for users to interact with the AI-powered research capabilities while monitoring the agent's reasoning process in real-time.

## 🎯 Project Requirements

### Core Functionality
Create a new Python file named `ui-deep-research-agent.py` that maintains all the functionality of the existing `deep-research-agent.py` while adding a modern, user-friendly graphical interface.

## 🖥️ User Interface Design

### Layout Structure
The application should feature a clean, professional layout with the following components:

### 📝 Input Section
- **Request Box**: A text input area where users can enter their research queries
  - Should support multi-line input
  - Clear placeholder text to guide users
  - Proper text formatting and sizing

### 📊 Output Sections

#### 📄 Research Report Panel (Main Output)
- **Purpose**: Display the final research results from the agent
- **Format**: Rich text rendering with full Markdown support
- **Features**:
  - Proper rendering of headers, lists, links, and citations
  - Scrollable content area
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality
  - Export options (optional)

#### 🧠 Reasoning Panel (Real-time Insights)
- **Purpose**: Show the agent's thought process and intermediate responses
- **Location**: Right side of the window
- **Format**: Rich text with Markdown rendering
- **Features**:
  - Real-time updates as the agent processes
  - Auto-scroll to latest content
  - Clear visual distinction from final results

## ⚙️ Interactive Elements

### 🔄 Progress Indicators
- **Loading Spinner**: Display over the Research Report box during agent execution
  - Modern, animated spinner design
  - Semi-transparent overlay
  - Clear visual indication of processing state
  - Automatic removal upon completion

### 🎛️ Controls
- **Submit Button**: Trigger research request
- **Clear/Reset Button**: Clear all content areas
- **Stop Button**: Cancel ongoing research (if possible)

## 🎨 User Experience Guidelines

### Visual Design
- Clean, modern interface design
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Proper spacing and alignment
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes

### Interaction Flow
1. User enters research query in the Request box
2. User clicks Submit to start the research process
3. Loading spinner appears over Research Report area
4. Real-time reasoning updates appear in the Reasoning panel
5. Final results render in the Research Report panel
6. Spinner disappears, indicating completion

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Markdown Rendering
- Both output areas must support rich Markdown rendering
- Proper handling of:
  - Headers and subheaders
  - Lists (ordered and unordered)
  - Links and citations
  - Code blocks and inline code
  - Emphasis (bold, italic)
  - Tables (if applicable)

### Real-time Updates
- Seamless integration with the existing agent's progress callbacks
- Efficient updating of the Reasoning panel without blocking the UI
- Proper threading to maintain responsiveness

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of connection issues
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery options for failed requests

## 📚 Implementation Notes

### Framework Recommendations
Consider using modern Python GUI frameworks such as:
- **Tkinter** (built-in, cross-platform)
- **PyQt/PySide** (professional appearance)
- **Kivy** (modern, touch-friendly)
- **CustomTkinter** (modern Tkinter styling)

### Integration Points
- Maintain compatibility with existing `deep-research-agent.py` functionality
- Preserve all environment variable configurations
- Keep the same Azure AI integration patterns
- Maintain citation and reference handling

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] UI launches successfully and displays all required components
- [ ] User can input research queries and submit them
- [ ] Research Report panel renders Markdown content correctly
- [ ] Reasoning panel updates in real-time during agent execution
- [ ] Loading spinner appears and disappears appropriately
- [ ] Citations and references are properly formatted and clickable
- [ ] Application handles errors gracefully
- [ ] UI remains responsive during long-running operations

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Consider these potential improvements for future iterations:
- Save/load research sessions
- Export reports to various formats
- Customizable UI themes
- Research history and bookmarking
- Advanced query templates
